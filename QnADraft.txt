<h2 style="text-align:center;">Interview Assistant for a Petition for Appointment of a Guardian for an Incapacitated Person</h2>
<p><b>Please Note: This interview just helps you prepare the petition. It does not give you any legal rights. You will need to file these documents with the court and a judge will make the decisions about your case.</b></p>
<p>This interview will help you fill out a "Petition for Appointment of Guardian for an Incapacitated Person" and assist you in beginning the process of appointing a guardianship for an incapacitated loved one. See a sample of the petition <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/08/vf/mpc120-petition-for-appointment-of-guardian-adult-fill.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>Answering these questions should take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. Once you have completed this interview, you will be prompted to download two documents: 1) a partially completed Adult Guardianship Petition, and 2) a summary of what your next steps will be. 
<br><br> Also note that from here on out we will refer to the <b>incapacitated individual as "Respondent,"</b> as that is how they are referred to in all court documents. </p>


Q(1): Before we get started, please make sure you have: <br>1) <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/08/xn/mpc400-medical-certificate-guardianship-or-conservatorship-fillable-2010.pdf" target="_blank">Medical Certificate</a> (needed if Respondent <b>is not</b> intellectually disabled)  or <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/08/nc/mpc402-clinical-team-report-fill.pdf" target="_blank">Clinical Team Report</a> (needed if Respondent <b>is</b> intellectually disabled), <br>2) Address, date of birth, and information about the Respondent, and <br>3) Names and addresses of any other interested individuals (e.g. spouse, parents, siblings).
A: I have that information, let's get started!
	Q(1.1): Has the Respondent lived in Massachusetts for the past <b>six months</b>?
	A: Yes 
		Q(1.1.1): Is the Respondent able to understand, make and communicate (even with help) decisions about his/her health, safety and well-being on his/her own?
		A: Yes
			Q(1.1.1.1): A guardianship may not be the right option for you. It is a requirement that the Respondent is unable to make these decisions in order to receive a guardianship. For more information, see <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/08/ug/mpc190-general-information.pdf" target="_blank">general information regarding Guardianships and Conservatorships</a>.
		A: No
			Q(1.1.1.2): Is the Respondent able to make financial decisions on his/her own?
			A: Yes
				Q(CAGuardian): Does the Respondent already have a court-appointed Guardian in Massachusetts or somewhere else?
				A: Yes	
					Q(1.1.1.2.1.1): Removing a current guardian, adding a co-guardian, or transferring a guardianship from another state is complicated and is beyond the scope of this online interview. You should contact an attorney for help with this case. If you need help finding an attorney who specializes in this area, you can visit the Massachusetts Guardianship Association <a href="http://www.massguardianshipassociation.org/" target="_blank">website</a>.
				A: No
					Q(1.1.1.2.1.2):GOTO:Interest
			A: No
				Q(1.1.1.2.2): If the Respondent receives yearly income and assets from any source, a guardianship may not be the right legal option. You should consult a lawyer for assistance with a "conservatorship." However, If the Respondent is only receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, you won't need a conservatorship. For more information on conservatorships, see <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/08/ug/mpc190-general-information.pdf" target="_blank">general information regarding Guardianships and Conservatorships</a>.
